This program can encrypt and decrypt text via rotation (also known as caesar) and substitution cypher and decyphering.

It is reccomended you use the exe included and don't try to compile the source code yourself. 
Furthermore, this is for WINDOWS ONLY as some functions are not portable to other operating systems. 

It has no error checking and therefore requires perfect input to avoid errors. Please be careful and read prompt before committing to inputs. 
Also, it is recommended you only input keys from 0-10 when using any rotation cypher functions as unexpected errors may result otherwise. 

Furthermore, to solve a substitution cypher without a key is exremely hard to achieve. Thus within this program, the results are better when more characters are entered. 
However, the user must nore there is a limit of 999999 characters for all messages to be encrypted/decrypted. Also, it must all be one paragraph. 

Good luck and have fun.
